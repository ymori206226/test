(2021/02/27) Tsuchimochi
1. Introduced "QuketData" class (init.py) to handle parameters/operators 
2. Accordingly renamed parameter names, the most important one being 'method' changed to 'ansatz'
3. QITE implemented, can be invoked by 'method = qite'

(2021/02/05) Tsuchimochi
1. Bug fixed for hubbard model and spin-projection (Sz part) in phflib.py 
2. Spin and Ms correctly treated in mod.py (specify 'multiplicity' to define Ms = (noa - nob)/2, and 'spin' to define actual spin 2s+1)
3. Introduced BCS and number-projection (agpbcs.py and NProj in phflib.py)
4. Introduced extended UpCCGSD 
5. Created upcclib.py module 

(2021/02/02) Tsuchimochi
1. Bug fixed for print_state (in fileio.py) and single_ope (ncnot undefined).
2. Introduced Gdouble_ope in expope.py for general double excitations.
3. Introduced spin-projection in k-UpCCGSD (breaks spin-symmetry by using the different signs between alpha and beta singles)
4. Added some useful documents in docs directory.

(2021/01/20) Tsuchimochi
1. method = SGHF is introduced for non-collinear spin projection of generalized HF
2. Formatted the program codes by "black"
3. read.py is added: the read-in code for input file is separated from main.py.
4. Bug fixed for mpi_bcast of theta_list and kappa_list. 

(2020/12/14) Tsuchimochi
1. Function for Spin-Projection 'S2Proj'. Args [SpinProj, euler, spin] are introduced.
2. Modified create_state and renamed to create_uccsd_state.
3. Added UCCSD excited states by penalizing the uccsd energy (orthogonally-constrained VQE). Introduced 'Excited' section to specify the initial determinants for excited states
4. Bug fix for LoadTheta, geometry section, multi section.

(2020/12/10) Tsuchimochi
1. Created quket script for running quket with MPI.
2. Added prop.py, which includes dipole and get_1RDM functions.
3. Replaced `generate_molecular_hamiltonian` (now removed) by `generate_operators`.
4. Corrected MPI broadcasting for operators in config.py (bcasted in `generate_operators`).
5. Defined printing wrapper `prints` in the newly introduced fileio.py.
6  Adjusted print appearances. 
7. Defined matrix printing function `printmat` in fileio.py.
8. Modified k-UpCCGSD so that singles are spin-free. Parameter # been changed.
9. Other cosmetic changes...

TODO
----
Need to reconcile the number of orbitals and active orbitals for property calculations.

(2020/12/04) Tsuchimochi
Added k-UpCCGSD (Yoshikura) and JM-UCC (Mori), with modifications. 
Introduced mpi4py to perform hybrid parallel calculations.
