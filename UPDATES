1. method = SGHF is introduced for non-collinear spin projection of generalized HF
2. Formatted the program codes by "black"
3. read.py is added: the read-in code for input file is separated from main.py.
4. Bug fixed for mpi_bcast of theta_list and kappa_list. 

(2020/12/14) Tsuchimochi
1. Function for Spin-Projection 'S2Proj'. Args [SpinProj, euler, spin] are introduced.
2. Modified create_state and renamed to create_uccsd_state.
3. Added UCCSD excited states by penalizing the uccsd energy (orthogonally-constrained VQE). Introduced 'Excited' section to specify the initial determinants for excited states
4. Bug fix for LoadTheta, geometry section, multi section.

1. Created quket script for running quket with MPI.
2. Added prop.py, which includes dipole and get_1RDM functions.
3. Replaced `generate_molecular_hamiltonian` (now removed) by `generate_operators`.
4. Corrected MPI broadcasting for operators in config.py (bcasted in `generate_operators`).
5. Defined printing wrapper `prints` in the newly introduced fileio.py.
6  Adjusted print appearances. 
7. Defined matrix printing function `printmat` in fileio.py.
8. Modified k-UpCCGSD so that singles are spin-free. Parameter # been changed.
9. Other cosmetic changes...

TODO
----
Need to reconcile the number of orbitals and active orbitals for property calculations.

(2020/12/04) Tsuchimochi
Added k-UpCCGSD (Yoshikura) and JM-UCC (Mori), with modifications. 
Introduced mpi4py to perform hybrid parallel calculations.
